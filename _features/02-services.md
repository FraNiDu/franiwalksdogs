My services include picking up/bringing back your furry child, walking out with him/her for an hour, I'll sent you pictures,
and if I notice anything out of the ordinary I'll let you know immediately.

My neighborhoods are: Rinchmond District, Laurel Heights, Presidio Heights, Cow Hollow and Haight-Ashbury.

I like to know my kids (and their parents) before taking them out, so go ahead an schedule an initial interview
