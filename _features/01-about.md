I love being able to share my time with doggies. It all started when a friend of CrossFit needed a dog walker, and I love his dog very much. From that moment, this is the best job you can have, I love looking at a happy dog ​​when I walk with you. From that moment I have dedicated myself to walking dogs and I love it. Some need to walk alone out of nervousness, aggressive behaviors and others can simply get out of four dogs because they love to share and have no problems between them.
