It all started when my friend at CrossFit needed a dog walker.
I was up for the task, I'm a dog owner myself, and I love sharing my time with doggies

A few days went by until I realized this is the best job I could ever have,
I love watching a happy dogs smile after a nice walk.

From that moment I have dedicated myself to walking dogs and I **love** it.

I've come to known them, and I understand some will need to walk alone out of nervousness or aggressive behaviors.
While others can simply get out on packs (4) because they also love to share and have no problems about it.
